# Operation-Analytics-and-Investigating-Metric-Spike
In today's data-driven world, businesses must analyse their operations and metrics to stay
competitive. This project aims to provide insights into two different scenarios of operation
and metric analytics. One of the primary goals of the project is to provide a dashboard that
displays key performance indicators (KPIs). The dashboard will provide a real-time view of
KPIs to help managers make data-driven decisions.
